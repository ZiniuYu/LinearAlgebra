Chapter 3.1 Spaces of Vectors
=============================

The vector spaces are denoted by :math:`\R^1, \R^2, \R^3, \cds`.
Each space :math:`\R^n` consists of a whole collection of vectors.

.. Note::

    **DEFINITION**: The space :math:`\R^n` consists of all column vectors :math:`\v` with :math:`n` components.

The components of :math:`\v` are real numbers, which is the reason for the letter :math:`\R`.
A vector whose :math:`n` components are complex numebrs lies in the space :math:`\bs{\rm{C}}^n`.

The vector space :math:`\R^2` is represented by the usual :math:`xy` plane.
Each vector :math:`\v` in :math:`\R^2` has two components that give the 
:math:`x` and :math:`y` coordinates of a point in the plane :math:`\v=(x,y)`.

The vectors in :math:`\R^3` correspond to points :math:`(x,y,z)` in three-dimensional space.
The one-dimensional space :math:`\R^1` is a line (like the :math:`x` axis).

The two essential vector operations go on *inside the vector space*, and they produce **linear combinations**:

.. Tip::

    We can add any vectors in :math:`\R^n`, and we can multiply any vector :math:`\v` by any scalar :math:`c`.

"Inside the vector space" means that **the result stays in the space**.

*A real vector space is a set of "vectors" together with rules for vector addition and for multiplication by real numbers*.

.. note::

    * :math:`\bs{\rm{M}}`: The vector space of **all real 2 by 2 matrices**.

    * :math:`\bs{\rm{F}}`: The vector space of **all real functions** :math:`f(x)`.

    * :math:`\bs{\rm{Z}}`: The vector space that consists only of a **zero vector**.

The function space :math:`\bs{\rm{F}}` is infinite-dimensional.
A smaller function space is :math:`\bs{\rm{P}}`, or :math:`\bs{\rm{P}}_n`, 
containing all polynomials :math:`a_0 + a_1x + \cds + a_nx^n` of degree 
:math:`n`.

The spzce :math:`\bs{\rm{Z}}` is zero-dimensional.
:math:`\bs{\rm{Z}}` is the smallest possible vector space.
The vector space :math:`\bs{\rm{Z}}` contains exactly *one vector* (zero).
Each space has its own zero vector.
